# hput
A standalone http server that you can program easily via http without knowing linux.
- http PUT web pages, text, pictures üñºÔ∏è üéµüéûÔ∏è or whatever, then send a GET, POST, PATCH, or DELETE to the same path path to return your payload ‚ú®.
- http PUT javascript to a path then call that path with any other verb to run your code
  - The last line of your javascript is returned as payload.
  - `express` style `request` and `response` objects can be used to run web programs.

## Start

### Launch with Go
You can launch the service directly with Go

#### Prerequisite:
Go v1.18

#### Start:
```
go mod download # gathers all dependencies
go run main/main.go -port 80 # runs the program as an http server, 80 is the default port number
```

#### Stop:
hold `control` and hit `c` on your keyboard

### Launch with docker-compose
#### Prerequisite:
Docker/Docker desktop and Docker Compose (usually comes installed with Docker)

Either a local version of all containers needed, or a docker login
```
docker login
```

#### Start:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Stop:
```
docker-compose down
```

## Use
You can send a PUT request to your server to save something.

Here is some Javascript that you can copy/paste. You can run javascript in browsers like Chrome [Chrome instructions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console/javascript/).
```
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest()
xhr.open("PUT", "http://localhost/test")
xhr.send("Hello hput")
```

Then, in your browser, input the URL: `http://localhost/test`

### Save your code
You can dump any subpath by a call to your <path>`/dump` to get code which will recreate your work on another hput server. Using the above as an example, visit `http://localhost/test/dump` or `http://localhost/dump` to output the same result, then you can paste that result into any javascript cli.

### Example payloads
Send any of these as an HTTP PUT payload, and see how the server responds
#### html loads as a webpage
basic hello world:
```
<html>
<h1>hello hput</h1>
here is some html
```
html with in browser javascript:
```
<html>
<h1>hello html</h1>
<script>
    document.write(`The date on your computer is ${new Date()}`);
</script>
```

#### server side javascript
Get the time 24 hours from now:
```
`tomorrow it will be: ${new Date(new Date().getTime() + 1*24*60*60*1000)}`
```


#### Combine both
1. Return the date, try putting this at `/time`
```
new Date()
```

2. Try putting this at `index.html`. If you've setup the server side javascript, you'll see both responses
```
<html>
<h1>browser and server</h1>
<div id="browser"></div><br>
<div id="server"></div><br>
The times should be the same. The first was calculated by your browser, the second by the hput server.
<script>
    document.getElementById("browser").innerHTML = `The date on your browser is ${new Date()}`
    fetch("/time")
      .then(response => response.text())
      .then((response) => {
        document.getElementById("server").innerHTML = `The date on your server is ${response}`
      })
</script>
```

## Start flags
| flag | description | default | other options |
| - | - | - | - |
| `-port` | which port to listen on | `80` | any int |
| `-nonlocal` | whether to allow traffic from a source other than localhost | `false` | `true` |
| `-storage` | which storage to use, currently supported: local disc and memory, which will be deleted whenever the server is shut down | `local` | `memory`, `s3` |
| `-log` | which level to set logging at | `info` | `debug`, `warn`, `error`|
| `-filename` | if using local storage, name of the database file to create and use. | `hput.db` | any valid file path |
| `-locked` | do not accept any http `PUT` commands to write, pass all commands to runnables | `false` | `true` |
| `-bucket` | if using s3, bucket name to read and write items to | N/A | any valid bucket |
| `-prefix` | If using S3, a prefix (folder) to use with object keys | N/A | any |

## More about the project
What would it look like if an http application was as simple to program as it is to visit? It would start with zero config, and accept static text, json, files or logical programs with single http calls. You'd program this http server the same way you use it: via http commands.

Web projects should be easy to start and keep the focus on your idea. Instead, web creators often have to learn to work with git, linux, apache, application servers, and language-specific frameworks before their server starts. Even cloud services and FaaS frameworks have their own concepts to master before you can start a project.

## Fast follow features 0.2:
1. Output whatever you replaced if you replace something
1. Ability to force a type of input
1. Add logs http output
